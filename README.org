Hello my name is Alex. I am secondary school student in Reading, Southern England. Lately, I have been both quite busy and very lazy. As a result, I haven't spent nearly as much time as I would have liked on programming. In the near future I plan to complete many more interesting projects...

I have used *GNU/Linux* on my devices for the last 2 years, in which time I have installed Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Gentoo and Arch on physical hardware and virtualised many other distros. My other interest include:

- Unix philosophy
- OS engineering
- C/C++ programming
- Functional programming
- ML/AI with Python
- Scientific modelling
- Emacs, Vim, Neovim etc.
- Shell scripting
- Window managers
- System configuration

Thanks for taking the time to look at my work!
